# CSCI313-Data-Structures-Project-1

## Reversed Linked List Project

This repository contains all the files that are needed to create, fill, and reverse the nodes of a LinkedList. This project was created while taking Dr.Alla Rozovskaya's CSCI313 Data Structures course at CUNY Queens College. This project utilizes the `append(int s)` method to create the nodes of the LinkedList using the entries entered by the user. The `reverse()` method reverses the ordering of the nodes. This project helped me learn more about data structures, specifically LinkedLists. 

## Binary Tree Project

Create a Binary Tree, append the requested nodes, then perform a pre-order traversal of the tree. 

## Recurvsive String Reversal

Takes a string input and recursively outputs its reversal.
